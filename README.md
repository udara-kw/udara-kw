# Udara Weerasinghe
Adaptive, creative and flexible character who improvises himself based on the environment. Prefer to analyze and dive deep inside concepts and explain everything in a simple manner with the intention of educating others on the particular context. Likes functional programming with JavaScript due to the dynamicity of JS. A fan of sarcasm! Learning science to do art.


## Functionality

```javascript
const currentJob = new Promise(value: <undefined>, onFulfilled: [commitForSuccess]);

function *enjoyLife(friends=❤️, music=🎼, parents=👪, job=currentJob) {
    try {
        job?.todo?.complete();
    catch(error) {
        exitFromRoom();
        music.start();
        friends.party("travel", "eat", "drink", "sarcasm");

        error.resolved ? yield error.resolved.solution : enjoyLife(friends, music, parents, job);
    }
    parents?.smile();
}

let life = enjoyLife()

while(True) {
    life.next( life.next() );
}

//if there are bugs, blame satan!
```
